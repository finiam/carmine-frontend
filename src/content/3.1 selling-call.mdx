## Calls

### Selling a Call

When you sell a call option, you take on the obligation to sell the underlying asset to the option buyer at the strike price if they choose to exercise their right. You expose yourself to unlimited upside risk. If the price of the underlying asset rises significantly, the option buyer may exercise their right to buy the asset from you, meaning your position would be liquidated in order to deliver the asset to the buyer.

    If the price of Ethereum remains below the strike price, the option will
    expire worthless (out of the money). You get to keep the premium received
    upfront, which becomes your profit.

    If the price of Ethereum rises above the strike price before the option's
    expiration, the buyer may exercise the option, resulting in a loss

###### Example

You believe that the price of Ethereum, currently trading at $2,800, will increase in the near future, so you go Long on a Call.

You decide to buy a call option on Ethereum with a strike price of $3,000 and an expiration date of one month. The premium for the call option is $100.

        type="In-the-money" 
        header="Price of Ethereum goes to $3,500" >
        - Strike Price of Call Option: $3,000
        - Premium paid: $100 
        
        **Total Profit: $3,500 - $3,000 - $100 = $400**
    </ConceptsExample>
    <ConceptsExample
        type="Out-of-the-money"
        header="Price of Ethereum drops">
        Price of Ethereum declines during the month and remains below the strike price of $3,000 until the option's expiration.

        - Premium paid: $100

        **Total Loss: $100**

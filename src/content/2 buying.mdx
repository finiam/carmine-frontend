## Intro
### Buying (Long)
There are some important concepts for you to consider when buying options:

#### Limited Risk

When you buy options, your risk is limited to the premium paid. This means you can define your maximum potential loss upfront, providing you with a level of control over your investments. As a buyer of options, your potential loss is limited to the premium paid.

#### Time Sensitivity

Options have expiration dates, and *their value diminishes as time passes*. If the underlying asset doesn't move in the anticipated direction within the specified timeframe, the option may expire worthless.

## Calls
### Buying a Call (Long Call)

Calls are typically used when you anticipate an asset will appreciate, allowing you to profit from the price difference. A good mental model to understand it is that of placing a bet that the price of the asset will rise. By purchasing a call option, you can potentially profit from the upward movement of the asset's price, without actually owning the asset itself.

## Puts
### Buying a Put

Puts are valuable when you expect the price of the asset to decline. A good intuition to understand it is that of a bet that the price of the asset will fall. By acquiring a put option, you can protect yourself from potential losses or even potentially profit from the downward movement of the asset's price, serving as a form of insurance or a speculative tool.
